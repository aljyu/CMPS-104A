This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Alice Yu (aljyu@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Andrew Lee (ale915@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner is a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spend working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different peice.

Alice Yu spent        _6_ hours working alone.
Andrew Lee spent      _5_ hours working alone.
We spent              _25_ hours working together.
Alice Yu spent        _13_ hours driving.
Andrew Lee spent      _12_ hours driving.
